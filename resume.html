          <h3>Trial PathWay</h3>
          <p>I made this project for a hackathon held by Regeneron. My application is called Trial Pathway which targets
            TRACK 2: Accelerating Clinical Trials - Open Source Tools and Resources.</p>
          <p>My application aims to improve the recruitment process, enhance communication, improve patient retention,
            and
            extract data for training AI models to detect points of failure in the clinical trial process.</p>
          <p>Tech stack: Flutter, Postgres, Postman, Hugging Face: Facebook BART NLP model.</p>

          <h3>SkillCourt</h3>
          <p>During the Fall semester of 2023, in the class Capstone II, I was the team lead for the SkillCourt project.
            The team was formed by 3 people, including myself. As the team lead, I had the responsibility to ensure that
            the team was committing to the Sprints and the goals that we set at the start of each week. I also
            coordinated
            the daily meetings at a time that would work at a convenient time for all team members and the product
            owner.
            After graduating in 2023, I have continued to contribute to the SkillCourt project, now beyond Flutter app
            development. I have developed an emulator in python to ease the testing and development process of the
            hardware pads and the mobile application.
            The main tech stack that I have worked with involves Flutter and Python, and the most relevant packages
            involve relate to web sockets, which in flutter is the shelf dart package.
