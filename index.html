      <!-- //  ABOUT ME  // -->
      <main>
        <!-- Start content edits below this line. -->
        <p>Experienced Full Stack Developer with a proven track record in diverse environments. My journey began with
          formative experiences, including internships at MDPCS and roles at Divieto Ristorante Italiano and Five Guys,
          where I honed my skills in IT support and customer service. These experiences instilled in me the value of
          adaptability and collaboration, skills I carry forward to every project.</p>

        <p>During my tenure as a Teacher Assistant at Florida International University, I supported Professor Richard
          Whittaker in managing a large class of Programming 1 students, grading assignments, and providing invaluable
          assistance to learners. This role not only solidified my technical abilities but also enhanced my
          communication
          and mentorship skills.</p>

        <p>Currently, I thrive as a Full Stack Developer at True Health Connect, where I play a pivotal role in
          developing
          proprietary software, collaborating closely with stakeholders to deliver solutions that meet deadlines and
          exceed
          expectations. Leveraging technologies such as Flutter, Firebase, Git, and Node JS, I contribute to creating
          cross-platform applications aimed at enhancing user experiences and streamlining operations.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I have had the opportunity to give back to the community and foster the next generation of
          tech
          talent. As a volunteer CS Instructor at Paul W. Bell, I led a team in tutoring middle school students,
          introducing
          them to the fundamentals of programming through the Google CS First Curriculum. Additionally, my role as Team
          Lead
          & Flutter Dev at SkillCourt allowed me to not only lead a project but also contribute beyond app development
          by
          developing essential tools like a Python emulator for further advancing the project.</p>

        <p>My commitment to innovation and impact extends beyond traditional boundaries. At the Health Tech Innovators
          hackathon, I developed Trial Pathway, an application designed to streamline the clinical trial process by
          enhancing recruitment, communication, and data extraction using Flutter, Postgres, and advanced NLP models.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to my practical experiences, I continually invest in my personal and professional development.
          Holding certifications in Postman API Fundamentals and SQL, I'm always eager to embrace new challenges and
          stay at
          the forefront of emerging technologies.</p>

        <p>I'm driven by a desire to create meaningful change through technology and am excited about the prospect of
          contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals. Let's connect and explore
          how
          we can make a difference together!</p>
